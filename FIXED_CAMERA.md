### **Check Terminal Output:**
Look for these messages when you capture:

- ✅ "DeepFace analysis complete"
- ✅ "Raw emotions: {...}"
- ✅ "Dominant emotion: [emotion]"

### **If Still Shows Neutral:**
1. Check terminal for error messages
2. Make sure lighting is good

### **If Shows Wrong Emotion:**
- Improve lighting
